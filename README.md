MD Simulation with the SMA Potential

Potential Descritption in doc folder

codes: sma.cpp
input: mdin

The code initializes positions in fcc and assigns random velocities.

*It should then calculate the potential energy, kinetic energy and forces/acceleration.*

The positions are updated using the Velocity Verlet Integration method. 

Radial distribution and Mean Squared Displacement are also calculated.
